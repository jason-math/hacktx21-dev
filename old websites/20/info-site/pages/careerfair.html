                    <h1>HACKTX CAREER FAIR ON GLIMPSE</h1>
                    <h2>Saturday, October 24th: 5:00-7:00pm</h2>
                    <p>
                        This year, we will be using <a href="http://app.joinglimpse.com" target="_blank">Glimpse</a> to host 
                        to host our virtual career fair! If you are planning on attending, make sure to download or view Glimpse
                        before the event, to lower the amount of time you'll need to set up. Join the career fair simply by 
                        typing in our room key: 5F094C. This will also be available on Discord. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Glimpse will ask you to upload your resume and profile information, and then it will match you 
                        with companies that are looking for people of your description. While you wait, you can visit 
                        with other attendees in the waiting lobby.
                    </p>
                    <p>
