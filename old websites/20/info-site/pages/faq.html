                    <h1>SUBMISSIONS</h1>
                    <p>Submissions will be taking place on Devpost! Submitting here will ensure that your team is eligible for swag. In order to be judged, you will need to fill out this separate Google Form. <strong>Submissions are due at 11 am CT on Sunday the 25th!</strong></p>

                    <h1>JUDGING</h1>
                    <p>We will be using Gavel to judge. Judges will be going in and out of a video call link between 11:30 am - 1 pm CT on Sunday the 25th. <br/><br/>
                        <strong>Please be in your meeting link this entire time!</strong> <br/><br/>
                        Make sure that your link is accessible to the general public and does not require a password to join. If a judge comes and finds no one there or is unable to enter your room for any reason, they will wait 1 minute and then move on. <br/><br/>
                        From 1 - 2 pm CT, if you opt in to project fair, your link will be sent to all attendees to hop in and learn about your project. If you sign up for this, make sure at least one member is in your room during this time. <br/><br/>
                        At the same time, judges will be having final round judging and discussing the winners. Closing ceremony will be from 2 - 3 pm CT and we will announce winners there. </p>

                    <h1>SWAG?</h1>
                    <p>Swag.<br/>
                    We will have swag for our US attendees. However, at this time, we will not be able to ship internationally. If you have an alternate address in the United States, we can use that instead. You will be eligible for swag ONLY IF you submit a project!! Even if your project is incomplete, we want to see it!! Additionally, we will be raffling out t-shirts at our events so come for a chance to win one!</p>

                    <h1>HOW DO I ASK FOR HELP?</h1>
                    <p>Our Discord HackBot has some built in commands for you to use! To request help from an organizer type in this command: !request organizer your question here. For a mentor, use this: !request mentor your question here. You can also ping sponsors if you have questions about their challenges. <br/> <br/>
                        The #questions channel is good for quick questions as well and our organizers will be there to answer anything that comes up.</p>

                    <h1>WHAT CAN I WORK ON?</h1>
                    <p>Anything you would like! We want this to be a space for you to learn and expirement. What you create this weekend doesn't need to be perfect or finalized and we encourage you to continue working on it after this weekend! A good starting point to come up with ideas is to think about common problems that you would like to work on and breaking down smaller ways to attack the larger problem.</p>
