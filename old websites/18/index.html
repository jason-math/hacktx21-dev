		<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<div class="column">
				<div class="pair">
					<h3>What should I bring?</h3>
					<p>Yourself, your valid university ID, a form of ID proving you are over 18 years old, a laptop, chargers, or anything else you might need within the 24 hours. Firearms, weapons, alcohol, illegal drugs, and power tools are not allowed. Smiles and high-fives are welcome.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="pair">
					<h3>Do y'all give travel reimbursements?</h3>
					<p>Currently we are not able to provide travel reimbursements due to departmental restrictions. We will let you know and provide instructions on how to claim your reimbursement if the option opens up.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="pair">
					<h3>What is a hackathon?</h3>
					<p>A hackathon is an event where students build an idea into reality. It's about learning new skills and coming up with creative solutions using technology. To help you along the way, we provide mentorship and workshops. Beginners are welcome! We have resources specifically for y’all such as a Hackathon 101 workshop.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="pair">
					<h3>How do teams work?</h3>
					<p>Teams can be up to 5 members. If you don't have a team, check out our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/freetail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook group</a>. Joining a team of new friends is the best part of a hackathon. To create a team, complete your individual registration. Then, create a team by going to your personal dashboard and create a unique name for your team. You can't have the same team name as someone else. Also, capitalization matters! Then, give that team name to your team members. They should input that team name when asked for the team that they want to join. After that, you're done with registration. You should be able to view everyone who is on your team.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="pair">
					<h3>How do I volunteer at HackTX?</h3>
					<p>Volunteer applications will go live a week after registration opens. Be sure to stay updated with our mailing list to get a reminder before volunteer applications open on September 14th.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="pair">
					<h3>How much money will this cost me?</h3>
					<p>Zero. Zip. Zilch. Nada. Nothing. Gratis. It's free. Freetail Hackers provides students with Wi-Fi, meals, swag, workspace, and prizes for all of our events!</p>
				</div>
				<div class="pair">
					<h3>What do I wear?</h3>
					<p>Wear whatever you are most comfortable in! No need to wear anything professional. However, we do require you to be within the <a href="http://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MLH Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="pair">
					<h3>Any rules?</h3>
					<p>All work must be done at the event. You can't demo something you didn't build. Don't talk about Fight Club. All attendees (hackers, supporters, mentors, volunteers, etc.) must abide by the <a href="http://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MLH Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

					<p>Hardware will be provided <a href="https://hack.mlh.io/hardware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by MLH</a>. We can't promise availability of particular items.</p>

					<p>Hints might be in the puzzles themselves or on <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/hacktx18puzzles/shared_invite/enQtNDM0MjY5MzA2NTM0LWUzY2U1NjQ0YWY5MzI0ZDc4YmY0NjFiZDZiOWQ3ODFmNTZmOGJhZjBmZWNjNmE5MDdiNjc1NzAwYjk3MjE1OWI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Slack</a>. Good luck!</p>
				</div>

					<h3><em>Puzzles</em> Why should I do the puzzles?</h3>
					<p>If you are one of the first to complete the puzzles, you might be eligible for guaranteed admission to HackTX! Also, they're fun! Hopefully...</p>
				</div>
				<div class="pair">
					<h3><em>Puzzles</em> Can I work on these with my team?</h3>
					<p>Please sign in with your personal account and do not share answers or procedures. You don't want to ruin the fun, right?</p>
				</div>
				<div class="pair">
					<h3><em>CTF</em> What is a CTF?</h3>
					<p>A "Capture the Flag" (CTF) competition is a hacking and computer security contest. Strings of text, referred to as "flags," are hidden or encrypted in a series of puzzles and challenges. During the competition, participants try to decrypt, hack, reverse-engineer, or exploit challenges in order to gain access to these flags. For each flag retrieved, teams get a certain number of points. The teams with the most points win. For the first time ever, UT's Information Systems and Security Society (ISSS) will be running a CTF this year at HackTX!</p>
				</div>
				<div class="pair">
					<h3><em>CTF</em> How will the CTF be run?</h3>
					<p>HackTXCTF will be 3 hours long and consist of several dozen problems that gradually increase in difficulty (and point value). The categories will include Binary Exploitation, Algorithms, Reverse Engineering, Cryptography, Web, and others. Some problems can be solved in a matter of seconds, while others may take hours. Writeups explaining the problems will be released once the event ends.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="pair">
					<h3><em>CTF</em> I have no prior experience! Can I still participate?</h3>
					<p>Absolutely! The CTF is aimed at both absolute beginners and seasoned veterans, and there will be problems spanning all difficulties. There will also be mentors from ISSS as well as various security companies present to help you.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="pair">
					<h3><em>CTF</em> How do I participate?</h3>
					<p>Make sure you're registered to go to HackTX first! Then, just show up to the CTF location when it is announced. Make sure you and your team members each have a laptop - the problems will be distributed online.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="pair">
					<h3><em>CTF</em> Do I need a team?</h3>
					<p>Teams are by no means necessary, but you're absolutely welcome to compete in teams of up to three. Just come with your team and you'll be able to register together during the event.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="pair">
					<h3><em>CTF</em> How can I prepare?</h3>
					<p>No preparation is necessary! That being said, if you'd like to learn more and are a UT student, ISSS hosts weekly meetings where they teach the basics of hacking and computer security, as well as CTF competitions every other Friday. Just go to <a href="https://isss.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">isss.io</a> to find out about the next meeting. There are also tons of resources available online. Github has a great collection of tutorials, explanations, and practice problems that you can use to hone your skills.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="pair">
					<h3><em>CTF</em> Are there prizes for the CTF?</h3>
					<p>There will be prizes! More details to come on the day of the event.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="pair">
					<h3>What if this FAQ didn’t answer my questions?</h3>
