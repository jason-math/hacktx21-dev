                <p class="faq-question">Who are the Freetail Hackers?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">We’re a group of UT Austin students who love organizing hackathons for college students who are interested in tech. We also love going to them. If you enjoy both of these, you should apply to join our team when applications open in December.</p>
                <p class="faq-question">Who can attend?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">You can attend if you are a college student over 18 years old! This includes undergraduates and grad students. You must provide your college ID at check-in.</p>
                <p class="faq-question">Why come to HackTX?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Whether you’re new to hackathons or are a hackathon wizard level 500, we welcome hackers of all levels of experience. For hackathon newbies, we’ll host workshops to help you figure out a potential project (music visualizer, anyone?). As always, you’ll have mentors to guide you through even the simplest of tasks, such as setting up your development environment or learning git commands.<br><br>
                For our more experienced hackathon level 500 wizards, you’ll be able to enjoy exciting new mini-events and snacks! We’ll be bringing out caffeinated chocolate and a super-secret, hackathon-wide collaborative project.</p>
                <p class="faq-question">What should I bring?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Yourself, your valid university ID, a form of ID proving you are over 18 years old, a laptop, chargers, or anything else you might need within the 24 hours. Firearms, weapons, alcohol, illegal drugs, and power tools are not allowed. Smiles and high-fives are welcome.</p>
                <p class="faq-question">Do y'all give travel reimbursements?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">We would like to provide opportunity for all hackers to attend HackTX. We will be giving out a limited number of travel reimbursements. We will not be providing reimbursements to college students in the Austin metro area. Devpost submissions will be required for reimbursements. We will require proof of transactions in order to reimburse. Reimbursements will be capped at $50.</p>
                <p class="faq-question">How much money will this cost me?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Zero. Zip. Zilch. Nada. Nothing. Gratis. It's free. Freetail Hackers provides students with Wi-Fi, meals, swag, workspace, and prizes for all of our events!</p>
                <p class="faq-question">What do I wear?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Wear whatever you are most comfortable in! No need to wear anything professional. However, we do require you to be within the <a href="http://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MLH Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="right-side col-md-6 col-sm-12">
                <p class="faq-question">What is a hackathon?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">A hackathon is an event where students build an idea into reality. It's about learning new skills and coming up with creative solutions using technology. To help you along the way, we provide mentorship and workshops. Beginners are welcome! We have resources specifically for y’all such as a Hackathon 101 workshop.</p>
                <p class="faq-question">Any rules?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">All work must be done at the event. You can't demo something you didn't build. Don't talk about Fight Club. All attendees (hackers, supporters, mentors, volunteers, etc.)  must abide by the <a href="http://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MLH Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
                <p class="faq-question">How do I register and when does registration open?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Registration will open on October 2nd at 5 PM! You can register as a team or individually. Teams are given first-come, first-serve admission and individuals are given randomized admission. To qualify as a team, all you need is at least two people, so grab a buddy!</p>
                <p class="faq-question">How do teams work?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Teams can be up to 5 members. If you don't have a team, check out our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/freetail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook group</a>. Joining a team of new friends is the best part of a hackathon. To create a team, complete your individual registration. Then, create a team by going to your personal dashboard and create a unique name for your team. You can't have the same team name as someone else. Also, capitalization matters! Then, give that team name to your team members. They should input that team name when asked for the team that they want to join. After that, you're done with registration. You should be able to view everyone who is on your team.  **We apologize for the confusion surrounding team registration. Previously, we stated that you would be given a randomly generated string; however, now you are able to create your own team name.</p>
                <p class="faq-question">How do I volunteer at HackTX?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">Volunteer applications will go live a week after registration opens. Be sure to stay updated with our mailing list to get a reminder before volunteer applications open on October 9th.</p>
		            <p class="faq-question">Where is HackTX 2017?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer">HackTX will be hosted at the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Omni+Austin+Hotel+Downtown/@30.2813394,-97.8085811,12z/data=!3m1!5s0x8644b5a741cb1c25:0x64dca85384a94364!4m8!1m2!2m1!1somni+hotel!3m4!1s0x8644b5a73c20f903:0xaa945f555da7262a!8m2!3d30.268982!4d-97.740335" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Omni Hotel in Downtown Austin</a>.</p>

                <p class="faq-answer">Please email us at <a href="mailto:hello@freetailhackers.com">hello@freetailhackers.com</a> if you still have any questions! We will be happy to answer them.</p>
