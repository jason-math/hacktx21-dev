# HackTX Landing Website

This is a work in progress.

## Local Development

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for your platform
1. Install the needed dependencies: `npm install`
1. Start the Sass watcher: `npm run dev`
1. Open the `index.html` file (or use `npm run serve` to run a virtual server)

You can now make modifications to the `style.scss` file and it will be automatically recompiled. Refresh your browser window to see changes.
